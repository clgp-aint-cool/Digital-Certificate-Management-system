# X.509 Certificate Management System — Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview

A web-based system for managing and issuing X.509 digital certificates for SSL/TLS.
Two user roles: **Admin** (Certificate Authority operator) and **Customer** (certificate applicant).

## 6. Security Requirements

- **Passwords**: bcrypt (cost factor 12+), never stored in plaintext
- **Private keys at rest**: AES-256-GCM encryption, key derived from user password or system master key
- **Root CA private key**: Encrypted with system master key, stored separately from DB if possible
- **JWT**: Short-lived access tokens (15 min) + refresh tokens (7 days), HttpOnly cookies
- **Transport**: HTTPS only in production
- **Input validation**: All endpoints validate and sanitize input
- **Rate limiting**: Auth endpoints (5 req/min), API endpoints (100 req/min)
- **Audit trail**: Every state-changing action logged with user, IP, timestamp
- **CORS**: Whitelist frontend origin only
- **SQL injection**: Parameterized queries / ORM only

---

- REST API development
- Cryptographic operations (key gen, CSR parsing, cert signing, CRL generation)
- Database design and migrations
- Authentication & authorization
- Audit logging
- Unit & integration tests
- API documentation

### Frontend Team (2–3 devs)

---

## 8. Definition of Done (per feature)

- [ ] Code reviewed and merged to `develop`
- [ ] Unit tests passing (BE: >80% coverage on business logic)
- [ ] API endpoint documented in Swagger
- [ ] UI matches design, works on desktop + tablet
- [ ] Audit log entry created for state-changing actions
- [ ] No critical/high security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest

---

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Crypto implementation bugs | High — invalid certs | Use well-tested libraries (Bouncy Castle / node-forge), extensive unit tests |
| Private key leakage | Critical | Encrypt at rest, never log keys, minimize key exposure in memory |
| Root CA compromise | Critical | Encrypt Root CA key separately, restrict admin access, audit all Root CA operations |
| Scope creep | Medium | Strict sprint scope, defer nice-to-haves to backlog |
| Integration delays between FE/BE | Medium | API contract (OpenAPI spec) agreed in Sprint 1, mock server for FE |

---

## 10. Milestones
